# Enacting-photosynthesis

Research in the field of cognitive science has empirically established the simulation aspect involved in the comprehension of language. The existence of such a phenomenon can be the basis for a learning science intervention. 
This project aims at improving the understanding of the common biological concept of photosynthesis by prototyping a learning science intervention. You can experience the initial version of this interactive system on a laptop/PC using this link: https://ambargithub.github.io/enacting-photosynthesis/Index.htm
